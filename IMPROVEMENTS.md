# HTTP Ping Server Improvements

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Configuration Management**
- Externalized configuration into a `CONFIG` object
- Added environment variable support for port (`process.env.PORT`)
- Made server name and version configurable

### 2. **Code Organization**
- Separated concerns into distinct functions:
  - `createMcpServer()` - MCP server creation
  - `createApp()` - Express app setup
  - `initializeServer()` - Main initialization logic
- Improved readability and maintainability

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Standardized JSON-RPC error responses with `createErrorResponse()`
- Added global error handler for unhandled exceptions
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Better error logging with meaningful messages

### 4. **HTTP Method Handling**
- Consolidated unsupported method handling into a single function
- Added support for PUT and PATCH methods (returning 405)
- Consistent response format for all unsupported methods

### 5. **Logging Improvements**
- Conditional logging based on `NODE_ENV`
- Removed excessive console.log statements that could interfere with protocol
- Added structured logging for better debugging

### 6. **Security & Performance**
- Added JSON body size limit (10mb) to prevent DoS attacks
- Proper HTTP status codes for all responses
- Consistent use of `res.json()` instead of mixing response methods

### 7. **Operational Features**
- Added health check endpoint (`/health`) for monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM and SIGINT
- Better startup logging with all available endpoints
- 404 handler for unknown routes

### 8. **Code Quality**
- Removed unused imports (`cors`, `InMemoryEventStore`)
- Simplified tool registration (removed unused parameters)
- Better async/await error handling
- More descriptive variable names and comments

## Original Issues Fixed

1. **Unused imports**: Removed `cors` and `InMemoryEventStore`
2. **Inconsistent logging**: Moved to conditional, structured logging
3. **Repetitive code**: Consolidated duplicate error handlers
4. **Hardcoded values**: Made port and other settings configurable
5. **Mixed response methods**: Standardized on `res.json()`
6. **Poor error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling
7. **No health checks**: Added monitoring endpoint

## Usage

The improved server can be run with:

```bash
# Default port 3001
node src/http-ping-server-improved.js

# Custom port
PORT=8080 node src/http-ping-server-improved.js

# Development mode with detailed logging
NODE_ENV=development node src/http-ping-server-improved.js
```

## Available Endpoints

- `POST /mcp` - MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- All other methods to `/mcp` return 405 Method Not Allowed
- All other paths return 404 Not Found

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Better code organization and separation of concerns
2. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful shutdown
3. **Observability**: Health checks and structured logging
4. **Security**: Input validation and size limits
5. **Performance**: Optimized error handling and response methods
6. **Standards Compliance**: Proper HTTP status codes and JSON-RPC responses
