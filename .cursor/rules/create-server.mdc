To create a new server, copy the [ping-server.js](mdc:src/ping-server.js) for the pattern and use the MCP SDK documentation
Add the server to servers.json so it will show up in the cli and readme and gallery
Do not print anything to console.log since this is a stdio service and you can't write to it without breaking the protocol
Look up the documentation for the mcp protocol if you need to.
