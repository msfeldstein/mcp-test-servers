To create a new server, copy the [ping-server.js](mdc:src/ping-server.js) for the pattern and use the MCP SDK documentation
Make sure to add it to [cli.js](mdc:src/cli.js) and [README.md](mdc:README.md)
Do not print anything to console.log since this is a stdio service and you can't write to it without breaking the protocol
